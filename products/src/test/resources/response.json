Working alongside other amino acids, lysine amino acid helps the body to build protein.</p><p>And why do we need protein? Because it makes up the structure of all cells and tissues in our bodies, including muscle tissue, internal organs, tendons, skin, hair and nails. It is pretty important stuff.</p><p>A lack of L-Lysine can result in difficulty concentrating, fatigue and irritability. L-Lysine for skin and stress</p><p>Lysine’s involvement in collagen production leads researchers to think that it may have positive benefits for the skin.</p><p>Research suggests that keeping blood L-Lysine levels steady by taking a supplement can even help to reduce the occurrence of cold sores in those prone to the pesky little blighters.</p><p>Lysine may also aid those suffering with stress and anxiety. Supplementing with this vital substance appears to reduce levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, and may be particularly helpful for those suffering from high levels of stress.</p><p><strong>L-Lysine versus Arginine</strong></p><p>Not all amino acids are created equal. In fact the amino acid arginine can feed viruses, causing us to fall ill more easily when our immune system is low.</p><p>L-Lysine is Arginine’s arch enemy because it blocks Arginine activity. This process can help us to defend against illnesses such as ear infections. It also supports L-Lysine’s ability to tackle cold sores.</p><p><em>Packaging colour and size may vary but product contents is as described.</em></p>",
